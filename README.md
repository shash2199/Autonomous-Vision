# Autonomous-Vision
I am very excited about Autonomous Cars and here is an application which uses the YOLO algorithm and non-max suppression to detect cars and localizes them! 

**References**: The ideas presented in this notebook came primarily from the two YOLO papers. The implementation here also took significant inspiration and used many components from Allan Zelener's github repository. The pretrained weights used in this exercise came from the official YOLO website.
